# PkmnTypeCalcRazorPages
Simple ASP.NET Razor Pages web app created as a way to learn ASP.NET. 
This app shows damage multipliers that affect defending pokemon. It uses the same library as PkmnCalcWPF.   
After selecting types and hitting the `Show damage taken` button it displays every possible attacking pokemon type and
a multiplier of its damage. The list of multipliers and types is sorted by the dmg multiplier from the highest to the lowest by default.  
At the moment there are no other sorting options available.
